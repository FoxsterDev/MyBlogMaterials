I wanted to share with you three key points that I found noteworthy from the recent Mobile Growth and Monetisation report from Unity.
You can download it here: Unity Gaming Report.
The report is based on a huge size of data collected throughout 2022.

1. The Impact of Offerwalls:
   Have you ever wondered how to keep players engaged over the long term? According to the report, players who interact with offerwalls have an impressive 90-day retention rate of 14%, compared to only 3% for other players. This suggests that using a multi-reward strategy can be even more effective, with 60–82% of offerwall conversions. This could be an important consideration for your strategy.

Despite the challenges posed by iOS limitations for offerwalls, integrating them could potentially boost your monthly ARPU. This could be especially significant if your current focus is mainly on in-app purchases or rewarded ads. On average offerwalls revenue is ~33% of total ad revenue.

I thought previously that approach to allow users to install other games from my that it is bad because so hard and expensive to attract new users. But from analytics, it said if your user is engagement with your product and you made a great offer deal in an offer wall it will allow him to play the game longer.

2. Exploring Custom Store Pages:
   The report highlights the benefits of Custom Store Pages, particularly for genres like Puzzle, Casino, and lifestyle games. These genres are early adopters of Custom Store Pages, making up 73% of current users.
   If your game falls within these categories and you haven’t yet explored Custom Store Pages, it might be a good idea to consider them. Else it will be easier for you to stay overboard.

It is not enough to create an excellent product but is a really important pack in beautiful packaging in the store to attract attention. I am delighted with the opportunities that today provides App store and Google store.

3. Revenue Strategy Segmentation:
   The report reveals that a substantial 77% of users make their initial purchase within the first 14 days. The best first IAP offer to a user should be from 1$ — 5$. Consider shifting your focus on reward video ads and offerwalls from 14 days, and then introducing non-user-initiated ads like interstitials after 21 days for potential revenue optimization.

It looks for me to be focused more on the first conversion of non-payer users to payers by gradually decreasing the price for the first bundle for 14 days and next possibly adding more placements to interact with reward videos. About non-user-initiated ads, I am not a fan of such an approach. But instruments to monetize somehow non-payers are not so much.

I’m curious to know if you’re already adopted some insights from this report or similar reports like SensorTower. Do you think these findings are still relevant, or do you believe they might be outdated given the evolving trends in the industry?

Looking forward to your thoughts in the comments.
