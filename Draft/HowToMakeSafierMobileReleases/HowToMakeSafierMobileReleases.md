# How To Make Safier Mobile Roll out Releases

App stores have a essential influence on the release process. To prevent frustration, it is crucial to consider their specific flow and see how they operate. 
Enhancing the release process to be more seamless and transparent is vital to ensure timely delivery of new content and features, 
thereby bringing features to your players according to your schedule. 
From a business perspective, establishing a predictable time to market holds great value, particularly for activities such as CRM or marketing campaigns.

Lets see on two major mobile stores Google and Apple store. Google Play Store held a 75% share of the mobile app store market and Apple store held a 75% share of the mobile app store market.

iOS applications generated over 87 billion dollars of revenue in 2021 compared to just under 48 billion from Android. 
The iOS market share might be smaller, but it is far more profitable than Android. [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2021)

>Gradual release is Phased release for AppStore and Stage release for Google

**Common limitation of app stores**
- You can not exclude directly specific players like VIP from target audience when roll out a new release.
- You can have only one gradual production release at the same time with the full rollout release.
- Review process usually takes about 1 day but can be up to 7 days in exceptional cases like during holidays or fixing compliance issues.
- Technical metrics came to App store dashboards with delays. It can be a critical time lag to mitigate impact of an issue on your audience.

**Key bullets to mitigate risks during roll out if your new release are:**
- Understanding level of risks for the new release from the development increment perspective.
- Defining tracked KPI metrics and abilities to monitor them.
- Choose right strategy for new release roll out.
- Have a plan B in case of critical issues in production.
- Have a calendar for some time ahead to plan everything accordingly app store holidays of avoid collisions with CRM events.

# How risky is your release?
That is really crucial to determine is **high risked** release or **less risked** release. Understanding of risks for a new release will help
to choose the best strategy for gradual opening with risks mitigations. 
Any changes in the build without remote configuring options will increase the risks. Due the logic when yuo update engine core for example
that can not be disabled by remote or segment it will add risks and one way to fix it will be release a hot fix and hope for fast users update.
Or you are not able to test the change on all target devices with full OS combinations
In this case only production test will give you understanding about stability of the release.

The hot fix will take time to develop a fix , to build new clients , to verify from QA and next to send for store review.
The store review can be up to few days and finally you have to push users to update the game. Usually forcing users to update the game will increase uninstall ratio.
But most importantly, valuable time is wasted and low engagement users may leave.

In opposite logic of defining high risks in a release,
**Less risked** will be when you can operate remotely new changes or some new content can be segmented or controlled dynamically and disable any unstable part of application 
if there happens any unexpected issues .

# Do you have defined **tracked KPI's of release** ?
Next when you are able to identify level of your risks for a new release you need somehow understand that everything is okay in production.
Users are not angry by bugs and there is zero unexpected critical issues. The key is here to choose right analytic metrics depending on strategy of your product.
And have built the real time monitoring or at least define third party instruments that will give answer with the lowest latency.

I believe defining your **tracked KPI's of release** and have clear source to check and compare them with the previous release is the second important bullet.

# Choosing the right strategy for roll out to decrease or fully avoid an impact of risky changes on your most valuable target audience ? 
Depends on discovered level of risks for the new release the roll out can be more or less aggressive in sense of target audience %.
If the release has high risks you have to be slower with increasing of target audience % to have more time for discovering issues and reaction on them. 
It should not be an issue if you have a calendar of changes for production.

Next ideally you have to define some segments of your audience by values came from your product. Lest assume you segment your audience per countries of users. 
This is regulated by store and you do not need to have third party instruments for doing that.
Usually it is enough to have 3 segments:
- Low tier countries.
- Medium tier countries.
- High tier countries + the remaining world

To be more concrete lest use the [Top Countries/Markets by Game Revenues](https://newzoo.com/resources/rankings/top-10-countries-by-game-revenues) and define
- Low tier countries - Nepal, Vietnam, Egypt, South Africa, Poland, Slovenia, Argentina.
- Medium tier countries - Germany, UK, France, Canada.
- High tier countries - USA/ China + the remaining world.

Next define some tracked KPI metrics and  potencial third parties:

Lets see 2 strategies for High risked and Low risked release.

**Strategy A**
![](./High_risked_release.png)

**Strategy B starting gradual release from low tier countries**
- Starting from Google stage roll out from acceptable percent 10% depending on DAU of target audience and low tier countries
- if technical metrics are acceptable lets add high tier countries and increase target to 50%.
- Send review iOS/amazon.
- if technical metrics are acceptable lets add US and other world.
- Check D2 retention for 2 versions for 2 days in US organic. 
- If business metrics are acceptable lets increase target to 99.9% for Google store.
- Start phased iOS release for 7 days and track technical performance. Business metrics mostly should be ok if you have crossplatform features. 

## important advice:
You have to compare KPI metrics between same countries and installs of same days and volume. 
You can make wrong decisions about stability a version when you compare 
a metric from version with 5k of sessions with a version with 1M sessions or to compare D2 for Vietnam location with USA D2.
Ideally you should take USA organic installs for last 2 days from the newest version and compare USA organic installs for last 2 days from the previous release.

How to choose Low tier countries: 
- No big revenue impaction
- Enough installs with reasonable adoption speed. If It is provide 100 installs for 1 week it is too long and not enough data to make any decision.
- Good variety of available devices with different models and different operation system. I could remember few cases when on some regions you get analytics and issues that is not corelated with other part of world. like most devices in Nepal are Vivo

The main reason to define low tier countries are to collect enough technical metrics to be sure that changes are safier and you continue 
rollout on other countries.

Less safest option but from analytics the most reliable option it is start gradual opening for all world countries from 5%-10%. Depends on installs and update trend of your product.
In this case you can control speed of installs target and will collect reliable analytics.

## general advice:
make full rollout only when you start a new release. lets put the main target adoption of a release to 99.9% for google. it will allow you to halt rollout
immediately in case of unexpected troubles in production. 
Otherwise you need to resubmit of client with new app version code to be accepted by store and pass the review again. When critical bug in production happens
and you could not decrease impact of an issue immediately by a remote option it makes sense.

## general advice:
make final smoke QA check before opening of the app on builds downloaded from stores(testflight , not distributed as a bundle or apk. for instance some functionalyt can be triggered only from store builds
like google referer api otherwise tou can miss the technical issues and be frustrated in production for real players. 

## One more thing you might be interesting to take a look:
- To be compliant with the newest of app store requirements. Like support new Android API for Google.
- To be compliant with app store quality guidelines.
- To know about gradual opening.
- To have ability to track your important KPI's in real time.
- To have options with excluding resubmit to store from your release process as much as possible.

- Have ability with the lowest latency to compare the KPI of the new version with the previous one and have ability to evaluate impact of an issue from UX and in general.


I recommend to separate technical and non technical changes into different releases to avoid mixing a lot of changes for big period of development into one release.
If you will see bad results in your tracked KPI for a new release it would be definitely hard to find a root cause. Is it an issue with new UI or there a technical issue with pushes that freeze devices?
My proposal to set a goal at least don't degrade the metrics. Because accumulative effect of changes for few releases at line will make impossible to detect a right root cause of degradation some metric.

Depending on risks to plan your releases without hurry and tests your risky changes on less valuable target audience.
From my personal experience  Google provide the best dashboard with valuable info about a release, AppStore of Apple less and Amazong says lets use your own systems or thirdparties.

Also it is good practice to make regular releases 2 per month or more. Decreasing size of new changes in one release wll reduce a chance to get unclear trouble in production
and will increase speed to diagnostic it and apply action items for fixing or reducing impaction.

## general advice:
make any significant changes in client are remotely operated as much as possible with new bundles or dynamic configs and if something will go wrong
you can adjust settings and fix them remotely without resubmit of client tos tore. In resubmit you should rely on fast stable rebuild client, it can have dependance on content rebuild,
testing again and waiting for review. **Review process on App store for instance sometimes can be really frustrated experience.**

From my point of view *Google play console* can provide the richest advantages to make the calmest release than App store or Amazon store.
And you can make gradual release with target % of adoption and countries and track performance of new release.
Also Google provide closed testings
